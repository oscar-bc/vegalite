24/03/2021 15:56:22,6,7,9,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,The error mentioned in the email telling me to broaden the results. This happened with Kinsale.,Overall layout and background pictures,"Some of the fonts and formatting in places, for example the drop down menus are in all caps, and there were some duplicates such as ""bar"", ""bars"", ""pub"", ""pubs"". I think it would also look nicer in some way to not have all the text in white boxes over the images, although I am not sure of other alternatives atm. ","Have some sort of drop down menu for locations when typing them in, for example when you type ""k"", kinsale, kilkenny, etc are listed, and the user can just select on there. I think this would really help in building on the intuitiveness of the website. 

Add dates in beside each day on the itinerary. 

Have the drop down menus scrolling themselves, rather than the whole page scrolling.

More details for the user when an error occurs as to what caused it i.e. was it not enough restaurants, couldn't find the location etc. 

A google maps link to each location on the itinerary.

Better definitions of the price brackets, i.e. what is cheap / expensive

Refine the drop down menus of activities and attractions to what's available in the area. This would help reduce the chances of an error occuring. If possible don't let a user select something that is not available in the location.

26/03/2021 13:01:25,Roly,10,8,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,No!,Makes you think about what you might like to do during a short break.,Too many types of food to choose from!,"1. The image on Home Page could be clickable, to let you get started immediately.
2. It would be very handy to have a pop-up that asks you if you are sure that you do not want to save the itinerary before leaving the page: I managed to leave one itinerary easily without saving it and had to input the info again.
3. A slide show of images on the first page would look inviting (as opposed to one static image).
4. ""Create Itinerary"" page looks a bit generic, not sure if glitzing it up is your job or the job of the web designer? Functionality good!
5. Add dates to each day of the itinerary?
6. Add clickable link to each venue on the itinerary?",10,Great way to start thinking about a holiday or short break!
26/03/2021 18:13:13,4,9,9,Yes,,Yes,,Yeah but there were some weird suggestions for breakfast.,"Got an error 500 message when I put in restaurants or activities not available. top of the restaurant list and activities list was cut off by the menu bar at the top of the screen, could not read the top option.","Easy to use, simple design.","Some UI issues, like restaurant list causes a scroll bar to appear on the side of the screen and the background/menus change size, and the words at the top of the screen change size depending on what menu you're in.","Would be nice if you could put in a starting date and the end date menu would pop up in the same month/year as it, rather than having to scroll through the months twice.",7,"I don't normally plan that much stuff on holidays unless there is something specific I want to do, so having a website like this would be good even to give a general idea of what to do even if you don't stick the itinerary perfectly."

27/03/2021 16:41:21,3,8,6,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,I had to broaden the search parameters a few times. There was also a N/A option under the drop down list for both food and activities.,I liked how the website presented me with restaurants and activities that I would not have been aware of beforehand. I also liked the direct link to tripadvisor so I could check out each restaurant and activity individually. The variety of restaurants and activities was great as well. Being able to save the itineraries to a user profile for later reference was useful too. ,"The drop down menu for food was a bit counterintuitive. Some options were too similar to others, for example bars/bar/beer and I did not know whether to select just one or all. Also I did not understand some of the options, for example South and Middle.",An indication regarding directions and how long it would take to get from each location to the other would be convenient. Maybe using information from Google Maps.,8,I liked how the website suggested restaurants and activities that I otherwise would not have known about. When I searched for an itinerary in Dublin I was recommended places that I have not heard of before and would definitely be interested in visiting. I would recommend the website for this reason as it gives a broad knowledge of a location before visiting.
27/03/2021 21:56:58,8,8,8,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,Yes. I got a server 500 error on the third itenary a couple of times (Dingle) until I changed some things like adding activities. ,It was very simple to use for the most part and quite intuitive,"Few nit-picky things: I feel like logout option should be on nav bar when logged in instead of profile page, when you sign up you shouldn't have to then log in (you should be logged in already), can't see the top option in dropdown menus for 'types of food' and 'interests'.",I would like to see a 'clear itenary' button on the itenary form to start from scratch. It would also be cool to see one or two itenary examples from the get-go to let us know how it will look before we create our own. Last thing that I think would be nice is to make the day schedules on the itenaries themselves collapsable so that it is easier to view specific days rather than scrolling all the way down.,10,"I think it is a really cool and innovative idea and has a lot of potential for future growth.

Not quite an error but when you get asked to broaden your search it clears what was in the search area, rather than letting you return and edit your query
The lists of food and activities went the entire length of the page, and had some strange types of options, especially the food list. 
The title of the itinerary list and the top option in the food and activity lists are blocked by the grey menu bar at the top of the screen","It was very simple to use, and has a very nice look and feel","When your query returns a Broaden your Search error, it removes what you previously has in your query","To be able to share the created itinerary, either with another user of the website by adding them as a friend, or by sending it as an email/link with the click of a button.
Group Itineraries, where multiple people can select different things in the query and everyone involved get the same itinerary planned for the group.
Possibly a checklist for the itinerary on the application, so after you complete an activity or go to a restaurant you can tick off that you have completed it.
Options, for example if 2 different food types are picked, such as Italian or Chinese, you can be given a choice of one of each type of restaurant for Dinner. 
A preference system when selecting food and activities, so you can give an order of which food types you like the most, or which activities you are looking to do the most",6,"It is quite a good concept, and once it has addressed some minor flaws it seems like it could be very useful."
